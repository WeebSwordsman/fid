<h1>About Jen's Kitchen</h1>
<p>The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some cases, I started with a recipe found in a
  cookbook or magazine, but over time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own.
  <i>Bon Appetit!</i>
</p>
<p>The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources.
  One day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
